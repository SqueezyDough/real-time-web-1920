# The ethical corona waiting room

To better understand socket.IO I've made a chat app. Users can send messages under a username or use a generated username. It's also possible to send a rabdom Corona gif using the /giphy command.

## Commands
- [X] `/giphy`: Send a random Corona Gif
- [ ] `/news`: Send a random Corona news article

## Messages
